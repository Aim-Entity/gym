REASON FOR PROJECT:

I got inspiration to do this project from a youtuber who said his first real world project is for a gym, I tried to emulate what he made and added my own spin on alot sections of the website. The youtuber was fox web school.

SKILLS I DEVELOPED:
I learn't how to use compelling colour schemes and design with a single page website. I also added unique layouts for mobile / tablet view. This project was also the first website I used javascript and JSAP.
